# rockfish5x5
5x5 expandable mechanical keyboard, powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico.

Shared for reference without licence. Not especially original. Feel free to use my design as a reference to design your own board, but I probably wouldn't reccomend trying to build this as is.

Entire design is upside down, and the uploaded revision has not been tested. To acheive the two board layout, the Pico goes on the right board and the solder jumpers are bridged on the left board.
